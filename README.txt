To address the issues you've mentioned, I'll refactor the Laravel code following your suggestions. The refactored code will:

1-Return JSON responses.
2-Include input validation using Laravel's Validator facade.
3-Handle cases where the user is not found.
4-Use a try-catch block for sending mail and log errors.
5-Use Mail::queue() to send emails asynchronously.
6-one function does many tasks, split it into multi-function to make code maintainable and readable and also break the single responsibility principle.
7-Utilize the ternary operator for simpler conditional logic.
8-Use model constants for roles instead of environment variables like User::SUPERADMIN_ROLE.
